SONET 66


*****

And art made tongue-tied by authority,
And captive good attending captain ill:
And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
And strength by limping sway disabld,
As to behold desert a beggar born,
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry:
Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
